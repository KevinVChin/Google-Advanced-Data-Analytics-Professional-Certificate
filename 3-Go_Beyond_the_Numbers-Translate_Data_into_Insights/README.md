### Module 1: Find and share stories using data

There are trends and stories hidden among the numbers and tables inside almost every dataset. In this part of the program, you will learn to tell stories using data and how to discover those stories by performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) and data cleaning. You’ll learn about the benefits and basic methods of data cleaning. You will explore different ways to visualize data and choose among them to suit the type of data you’re representing and your audience. 

### Module 2: Explore raw data

Cleaning a never-before-seen dataset can be daunting, but there is no need to fear. For this part of the program, you will be making sense of raw data by using powerful functions and libraries in Python. You will learn to perform EDA practices of discovering and structuring using Python, and you’ll discover that finding stories using EDA and the PACE workflow is all about gaining a thorough understanding of your data. 

### Module 3: Clean your data

At this point in the course, you’ll know what is in your dataset, but what’s next? In this part of the program, you will learn three more EDA practices: cleaning, joining, and validating. You will learn the importance of performing these practices on your data, and you’ll practice using Python notebooks to clean, validate, and join data. 

### Module 4: Data visualizations and presentations

Once you have learned how to find the story and clean the data, it’s time to share it with others. For this part of the program, you will learn to create and present your data stories in an ethical, accessible, and professional way. You will learn to use Tableau, one of the best visualization platforms for data scientists, at an advanced level.

### Module 5: Course 3 end-of-course project

To conclude this part of the program, you will have the chance to demonstrate what you’ve learned in an end-of-course project. You will select a scenario outlining a business challenge, and you will be tasked with using the data provided to solve the problem. The concepts and skills you will learn in this part of the course will be critical to your success as a data analyst in the future.
