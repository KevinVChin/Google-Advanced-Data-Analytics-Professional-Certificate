### Module 1: Introduction to statistics

In this section of the course, you’ll learn about the foundational role of statistics in data science. This section focuses on fundamental concepts of descriptive statistics, such as measures of central tendency, dispersion, and position. 

### Module 2: Probability

You will learn about fundamental concepts in probability. The first half of this section covers basic rules of probability (complement, addition, multiplication), conditional probability, and Bayes's theorem. The second part concentrates on three probability distributions: the binomial, Poisson, and normal distributions. 

### Module 3: Sampling

In this section of the course, you’ll learn about the concept of sampling and its applications in data work. The section begins with an overview of inferential statistics and the relationship between sample and population. This is followed by a summary of the sampling process, and the benefits and drawbacks of specific sampling methods. You’ll also learn about sampling distributions for both means and proportions.

### Module 4: Confidence intervals

This section explores how data professionals use confidence intervals to describe the uncertainty in their estimates. First, you’ll get an overview of the general procedure for constructing a confidence interval. This is followed by an explanation of how to properly interpret a confidence interval. Finally, you’ll be presented with detailed examples of how to construct a confidence interval for both means and proportions. 

### Module 5: Introduction to hypothesis testing

This section of the course describes how data professionals use hypothesis testing to help determine whether their results are statistically significant. First, you’ll get an overview of the general procedure for conducting a hypothesis test, and guidelines for interpreting the results. Then, you’ll examine detailed examples of how to conduct both one-sample and two-sample tests. 

### Module 6: Course 4 end-of-course project

In this section of the course, you will produce a tangible artifact that you can add to your professional portfolio and present to future employers. For this project, you will use your knowledge of statistics to conduct a statistical test that’s based on a workplace scenario.
