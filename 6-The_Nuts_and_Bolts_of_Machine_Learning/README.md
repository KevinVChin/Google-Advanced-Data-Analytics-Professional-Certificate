### Module 1: The different types of machine learning

In this section of the course, you will learn about the high-level landscape of machine learning and explore two of its main types: supervised and unsupervised learning. You’ll also analyze different types of data, determining whether they are categorical or continuous variables. You’ll learn about a type of modeling called a recommendation system. Finally, you’ll consider the ethical issues related to machine learning and learn some best practices for building ethical models. 

### Module 2: Workflow for building complex models 

In this section of the course, you will learn about the whole process of machine learning, from starting out with a business problem and creating a model to solve it. You’ll understand more of the preparatory steps that are needed to create a successful model, create a model of your own, and analyze the performance of the model in relation to the business need.

### Module 3: Unsupervised learning techniques

This section of the course focuses on unsupervised learning. You’ll learn how to build a K-means clustering model and explore several other clustering techniques. You’ll understand how unsupervised and supervised learning methods are different, and when and why to apply each type of model. 

### Module 4: Tree-based supervised learning

In this section of the course, you will learn about tree-based modeling. Tree-based models are more advanced predictive techniques that fall under the umbrella of supervised learning. You will learn about decision trees and how they can be used to approach classification problems, as well as complex models, such as random forests, adaptive boosting, and gradient boosting. Finally, you’ll learn how tuning hyperparameters can help you get the best performance out of your model. 

### Module 5: Course 6 end-of-course project

As you conclude this part of the Advanced Data Analytics Certificate, you will put everything you’ve learned into one end-of-course project. You’ll be tasked with solving a business problem using the provided data. The concepts and skills you will learn in this part of the course will be critical to your success as a data professional.
